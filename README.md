#Basic GET Proxy for Google App Engine

Basic GAE application that I'm using to enable CORS in basic JSON GET APIs.

Just set the domain URL in the `$endpoint` variable in `index.php`, publish the app on Google App Engine and you are all set.

It does not support a single fancy thing and all the code is in the Public Domain.
